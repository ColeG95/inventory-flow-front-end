# InventoryFlow

InventoryFlow is an inventory/warehouse managing application. Our purpose is to make viewing, modifying, deleting, and adding inventory to your warehouses seamless.

# Main Tools

### Inventory Management

This is the screen that summarizes your data in a table, as well as gives you access to itemized details.

Incorporated in this screen is the ability to modify your data. You can create new records, delete records, move inventory in the database, and let your warehouse workers know when to ship inventory to another warehouse.

Our multi-filtering and color coded inventory-status markers make working within InventoryFlow intuitive and easy.

### Main Dashboard

The Main Dashboard is where you go to get a visualized summary of you businesses KPIs. This feature is still in development, but will be released soon, TBD.

This gives the administrator access to view all actions made by other employees working within InventoryFlow. Each new, deleted, or modified record will be recorded with a timestamp and the user who performed said action.

### Users & Permissions

Within this screen, the admin can control who else has access to his/her data, and who can have read, edit, delete, or admin priveledges.
